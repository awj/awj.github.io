Solve a mystery on a remote island where nothing is quite as it seems.

# Setting
Caledon is an archipelago nation caught in the middle of two warring empires. The Caledonian King, absorbed in defending his nation during this conflict, has turned most administrative duties over to adventurer's guilds to act as regents for their islands. They are responsible for keeping peace and collecting taxes to fund the navy that keeps both empires at bay.

Many guilds are little better than state-sponsored gangs. Some make a real effort to protect the people under their stewardship. Regardless, most of the islands of Caledon view themselves as being on their own.

One of the more reputable adventurer's guilds is the Hands of Karn. Led by Karn, a retired Caledonian Naval officer, the hands see themselves as a force for peace and stability in this increasingly lawless island nation.

## Mood
We're mostly going for "spooky" here, kind of like a more serious Scooby Doo. Some kind of local spirit appears to be killing the wildlife, and seems to have also gone after the prior adventurer's group. Most of the town seems absolutely convinced that this spirit is the culprit, having grown up with legends about it.

## Adventure
Your party is an investigation team within the Hands of Karn. A group of guild members sent to collect taxes from the backwater island of Ardea is now a week overdue. Attempts to Scry them indicate the group is still on the island, but have not given more useful details.

The adventure starts as your party arrives at the island, tasked with finding the guild members and bringing them home.

## Character Requirements

You should make a level 4 character with a background, skills, and abilities suitable for a mix of investigation and combat. In addition to normal class skills, as an agent of the Hands of Karn you are proficient in Investigation or Perception and one Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom based skill of your choice.

Although you *are* allowed to make a character who is originally from Ardea, this character will not have seen the island for several years.

The core DnD books, plus Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and Xanatharâ€™s Guide to Everything are available resources. Your character *must* be a member of the hands of Karn, but any available backgrounds are allowed.

Your character will have normal starting equipment for their class/background, 2 potions of healing, 1 potion of greater healing, an uncommon consumable item of your choice, and an uncommon permanent item of your choice.

The party has been sent with a dowsing rod that points to the magical seals used to identify all members of the Hands of Karn.

# Mystery Breakdown
Another party from the same adventurer's guild was sent to the island, and did not return. They were murdered by being pushed off a cliff, as was an unidentified Caledonian Naval officer. This all appears to be the work of Death's Shade, a vengeful spirit of local legend that appears to have grown active recently.

## Who did it
Lysandre, the lady who runs a bookstore in town.

## Why
Lysandre is secretly a Warlock who stole an enormous amount of gold and ran away from the Caledonian Navy. The unidentified naval officer was an investigator who managed to track her down. She suspected that the prior adventuring party was sent to apprehend her, and ambushed them first.

## How
She has been using her Warlock abilities to pose as the Death's Shade. Under the guise of investigating this myth, she lured the prior adventuring party out of town and tossed them off a cliff. She used a similar ploy to deal with the naval investigator sent to pursue her.

## Lysandre's plot
Since the prior party was killed, she has been posing as the Death's Shade and killing town livestock and local wildlife. She intends to try to hold a fake ceremony to quiet the spirit, which she hopes will convince the party that no further digging needs to happen. If that fails, she will flee to her bookshop which functions as a Lair for a final standoff.

# Clues
Here's a list of all the clues that can be found, and which out of who/why/how they help answer.

## Bodies at the cliff base
*Where* washed into a cave below the cliff altar
*Questions* How, Who, Why

The bodies of the prior guild party *and* the older corpose of an unknown naval officer are all found washed into this cave. Only one of the party members has their Hand of Karn seal. All three bodies bear scorch marks similar to those found on local wildlife killed by the Death's Shade.

The dowsing rod will point them towards this. If the party doesn't think to use it a local child tells them she found something awful in the cave, but doesn't want to go back for fear that the Death's Shade will come for her. 

## Gar's drunken rant
*Where* first trip to the inn, or he finds them on day two
*Questions* How, Who

Gar rants that he saw the Death's Shade murder the party members by blasting them off the cliff. Dark cloak, skull for a face. He thinks the shade knows he was spying on it, and has been killing his sheep ever since. He tells them Lysandre is working on a way to put the shade to rest.

## Lysandre's shop
*Where* bookshop in town
*Questions* Who, Why

Surprisingly well stocked for the size of the town. She apparently loves her incense, a compelling mix of cinnamon and leather.

Lysandre gives the party a breakdown of the local legend of the Death's Shade, and claims she's been researching a way to try to put it back to rest.

Investigation (15): tucked away in a corner, you find a pack that seems to belong to the naval investigator. Lysandre hastily claims she found it during her research into the Death's Shade. She thinks the investigator may have angered the Shade, and suspects she might be able to use some of his items to help put it to rest.

Investigation (20): peeking out from a high shelf, or maybe within any hidden areas they rummage through, they find a cloak with a Caledonian Naval insignia. The cloak is clearly too small to fit the deceased officer.

## Lysandre's shop - backroom
*Where* living quarters / backroom to the bookshop
*Questions* Who, Why

If the party uses the dowsing rod to try to find the *other* Karn insignia, they get a very faint signal that leads them back to town. Spending time triangulating points towards this room.

They find the insignia in a chest tucked behind a false wall in the cellar. Inside the chest they also find the packs of the previous adventurers, and a significant amount of gold.

## Barassus
*Where* his home in town
*Questions* Why

Barassus is able to identify the naval officer as an investigator who came through looking for a runaway soldier who had stolen from the Caledonian Navy.

## Death's Shade Stakeout
*Where* the forests outside of town
*Questions* Who, How

The party sees Death's Shade kill one of Gar's sheep by apparently blasting it with some kind of dark energy that threw it back. Gar cries out as seeing this, which causes the Shade to fly off into the woods at high speed.

Examining the sheep shows the same scorch marks they find on the cliffside bodies. There's a lingering smell that seems familiar from town, which they put together as Lysandre's shop if they return to it.

Investigation (15): they find bootprints along the path the shade took to approach the sheep. No bootprints are seen along the path the Shade ran away.

## Sanzir - checking in at the inn
*Where* the inn
*Questions* Why, How

Offhandedly mentions that the naval investigator said he was close to finishing his business and heading home. Wants the party to pay for the stay of the previous adventuring party, who seemed to have cleaned out their rooms and left overnight.

## Sanzir - journal recovery
*Where* the inn
*Questions* Who, Why, How
*NOTE* only use this if the party is stalled

She has an encoded journal the military investigator had hidden in his room. Deciphering it (Investigation: 15) gives the description of Lysandre as the runaway naval member.
