Solve a mystery on a remote island where nothing is quite as it seems.

## Setting

Caledon is an archipelago nation caught in the middle of two warring empires. The Caledonian King, absorbed in defending his nation during this conflict, has turned most administrative duties over to adventurer's guilds to act as regents for their islands. They are responsible for keeping peace and collecting taxes to fund the navy that keeps both empires at bay.

Many guilds are little better than state-sponsored gangs. Some make a real effort to protect the people under their stewardship. Regardless, most of the islands of Caledon increasingly view themselves as being on their own.

## Mood
Overall theme we're starting with here is "unsettling". Magic nobody understands, nature itself behaving oddly outside of town, and nobody there seems to really be bothered. Odd outbursts from townspeople help to punctuate this mood and drive the plot forward. Death's own Avatar apparently wants to kill people.

As things progress, we shift more into a horror mode. The one character they met who *does* seem bothered suddenly is behaving like everyone else. Seemingly the whole town does not eat or sleep. The area outside the boundary is clearly dangerous, trapping the players in it.

For the third "act", we go into true horror. The players encounter someone who *clearly should be dead*, but is both not dead and also not aware of their problem. The party realizes that *this* is what Death's Avatar was talking about, and that they need to help set things right.

## Adventure
The party are all members of the Hands of Karn, one of the more reputable guilds in Caledon. The backwater island of Ardea, home to a single farming village, is now a month late in sending their ship to collect supplies. Given that this ship *also* was supposed to bring in the island's taxes, they have been tasked with going to Ardea to determine what is going on.

Their guild has chartered a ship to deliver both them and the town's supplies. They have been directed to venture inland to the town and seek out Barassus, the town's elder and main contact for the guild.

## Pre-adventure history
*NOTE: this section is intended entirely for reference and gives away the entire mystery. Don't read it to the players. It's intended to help you in explaining the motivations and actions of the NPCs.*

### 2 years ago
Lysandre and Vernalis retired from the Caledonian Navy, where they were part of a special unit tasked with securing artifacts that could be used in the country's defense. Vernalis had contracted a magical parasite, one which stripped him of his connection to his god and was slowly killing him. All attempts to remove it failed, and they left the Navy to pursue their dreams of a small town life together with what time he had left. Seeking to put their painful adventuring past behind them, they posed as a retired priest and bookseller.

Lysandre secretly had stolen some ancient runecrafting materials, including Syndasmosite, an ore capable of blending together schools of magic in ways the world had forgotten. She hypothesized that a careful application of warding runes could stave off Death itself, something normally far beyond her powers. As Vernalis's health worsened, she launched a desperate attempt to save him by literally creating a barrier against Death.

### 6 months ago
Karis, separately, was discharged from her adventurer's guild. Broken by the horrors of watching her few friends die, she sought a life of solitude in the middle of nowhere. Always a bit of an outcast due to her Tiefling ancestry, her contact with members of the town was rare. She took up residence in a cabin in the woods, content in her solitude with nature.

Unfortunately for her, this coincided with Lysandre completing her death ward. During her frequent ranging through the woods, Karis saw Lysandre placing a ward stone. As Death's rage slowly ramped up outside the barrier, Karis concluded that the wards were a timely defense they should all be greatful for. Deep in denial, she forced herself to focus on her forest and her animals, and remained largely ignorant of what was happening in the town.

### 5 months ago
Vernalis, who had declined rapidly, finaly died. Because the ward prohibited Death's avatars from entry, he began a quasi existence as a Revenant. He was not dead, but also was not really alive. The ward fuelled his body, drawing life energy from outside to help sustain him.

He was *deeply* angry with Lysandre for what she had done, and insisted she release the ward and allow him to pass away. Lysandre could not bring herself to do it, and instead used more Syndasmosite to craft what she dubbed a "Memory Auger" under the altar of the church. This device worked in tandem with the Death ward to continually altered a Revenant's memories. She initially planned to use it to prevent Vernalis realizing what had happened. She also was able to expend some of her own magical power to control Revenants under the effects of the device.

The device, however, needed human souls to power it. Lysandre initially chose Barassus to sacrifice. Spilling his blood over the altar and down into the device. Because she killed him *inside* the ward's boundary, he also became a Revenant. Because he was a Revenant, he too could be controlled by the device.

As the town increasingly began to realize something was amiss, Lysandre was forced to murder more and more townspeople. Each Revenant that arose went back to life "as normal", with the Memory Auger stealing away any realization that something was wrong. However, each Revenant also angered Death further. Death's Avatar went on a rampage, often killing creatures outside of the boundary.

### 1 month ago
Caranus, now one of the few living members of the community, packed up to bring in taxes and gather supplies. As he was about to leave Death's Avatar, now overcome by rage, found and murdered him.

Lysandre, now unable to leave the boundary, began working on one last device. This would alter the memories of anyone who came to check on the island to conclude that the town had been wiped out by an earthquake, and the island was now broken and uninhabitable. Unfortunately for her, she hadn't quite finished when the party arrived.

## Notable areas

### Dock
The dock is small and roughly made, but serviceable. A well-trod dirt path leads off from the dock into the woods. The island's ship is tied up at the dock. It lies in a small harbor, and barely has enough space for your ship and the island's ship to tie up together.

### Town
The town of Ardea is exactly what you would expect for a remote backwater. Maybe around 200 people live on the island, most clustered in or around the town. The town features a small inn built from sturdy wood, a crumbling church constructed from black lava stone, and surprisingly a bookseller in a tiny, cute shop. Other than that it's mostly homes.

If the players arrive at night, the town is surpisingly *busy* given its size and how little there is to do. Any characters stopped by the players state that there's no special occassion, and apparently it's just coincidence that so many people have decided to be out.

## Encounters

### Dock search
No signs of life. There are a lot of dead fish floating in the harbor near the dock. The island's ship is loaded with now-spoiled food and other goods clearly meant as taxes. The boat was fully prepared to leave, including a manifest and sea charts with a route planned to deliver taxes.

#### Investigation > 15, Survival > 10
The foodstuffs appear to have been left here for about four weeks, a timeline that lines up well with when the ship was due to depart.

### First travel down dock road
Discover the dead body of an older man (Caranus, the ship's captain). He holds a bow in his hands, and there are arrows embedded in a nearby tree. No apparent cause of death, even with a Medicine check.

#### Investigation > 15, Medicine > 10
The body appears to be about four weeks dead. You would expect some amount of carrion activity, but it's generally undisturbed aside from decomposition.

#### Investigation > 15, Perception > 10, Passive perception > 15, Nature proficiency
As you travel down the road, you realize that the forest is increasingly just ... dead. You don't hear signs of wildlife, and many of the plants are outright dead. There are no signs of disease on either the living or dead plants, and the live ones seem fully health.

### The Boundary
Along the dock road, well outside of town, the party notices a point where it feels like there's a wall of warm air headed towards town.

#### Passive Perception > 16, Active Perception > 13, 2nd trip across the boundary
There's a *remarkably* even line with dead plants on one side and live ones on the other, that lines up exactly with the point where the air grows warmer. One bush that straddles the line is quite literally half alive and half dead.

#### Scout along the boundary
Come across a black lava stone with unknown sigils. Arcana > 10 or Detect Magic reveal an unusual mix of Necromancy, Transmutation, and Abjuration.

#### Sleep or travel overnight outside boundary
An Avatar of Death appears and attempts to touch one of the PCs.

If touched, a PC hears: "People in that town MUST die"

If the party repeatedly encounters the avatar, they get:
"You must displace the hallowed circle"
"Someone has built an abomination before nature"

Avatar does not respond to questions, and vanishes after making a statement. Also leaves if it takes more than 20 points of magical damage.

#### Party displaces a ward stone
Death "seeps in" the boundary, killing off some plants near the stone. If this happens at night, triggers an encounter with the Avatar of Death.

---

Gar is murdered in the church overnight, rises up and resumes normal activities. No longer wants to talk about the boundary, but also refuses to go near it. Lysandra sneaks out to replace the stone and augment the boundary with a new ward stone formed as part of the ritual where she murdered Gar.

### Barassus
You find Barassus in his house, apparently reading. He's an older man, and seems a bit dottering. He confirms that Caranus left to bring in the taxes, and is surprised that it's been four weeks since. He directs the players to the inn as a place to stay, and says they can arrange to pick up supplies in the morning.

As the players are leaving, Barassus shouts out from a brief moment of lucidity. He rants that something is *deeply* wrong. Nobody eats. Nobody sleeps. Nobody leaves. After this outburst, he goes back to dottering and does not recall these statements. On subsequent encounters he does not appear to remember meeting the players, but also has no further outbursts.

### Bookshop
Lysandra is eating something when the players arrive. Willing to give a brief overview of her and Vernalis's history, but omits that they are former adventurers. Claims that this bookshop is more something to keep her busy than a real business, she's here because Vernalis is here.

Blames Karis for the boundary.

#### Sneak in investigation (Stealth > 10 overnight, or distract Lysandra)
Granite block shows clear signs of arcane carving. These are similar to ones on other ward stones if encountered.

(Investigation > 15): They find a bag w/ wizard's spell components in Lysandra's things.

### Passive Perception > 18, Perception > 15, Investigation > 10 (if allowed)
Table in the back has some books and a shawl haphazardly stacked on top of carving tools and a black lava stone block. If called out, Lysandra claims to have taken up carving, no business here.

### Church investigation
Bits of blood under the altar. If Vernalis is present, he mutters "I can't believe she would dare". On follow up questioning he tries to pin "she" as Karis.

#### Investigation > 20
They find a carefully disguised drain in the stonework under the altar. Literally ripping up the stones reveals the Memory Auger, which none of them are able to understand besides identifying it as a complex magical device that blends the Necromancy, Enchantment, and Illusion schools of magic. Doing this also alerts Lysandre.

Destroying the device causes the Revenants in town to begin accessing their memories, which results in utter panic.

### Tavern
On first visit, Gar is here, and *very* drunk. He's afraid to range his pigs outside the boundary after his oldest boar died immediately after crossing it.

Sanzir is happy to have business. Things have been especially slow the past few weeks. Confirms Karis's report that local wildlife started dying off outside what they've come to call "the boundary" about six weeks ago. She doesn't know where it came from, just that things are spooky outside of it.

#### Overnight stay in the tavern
Sanzir is up doing *something* at all hours of the night. Even if it's polishing a bar top that clearly doesn't need it. Claims she isn't able to sleep.

### PCs Persuade Gar to take pigs out
(Persuasion > 15) While taking his pigs across the boundary, one of them dies again. If it's night time or a player has some mechanism for magical sight/senses they see that the Avatar of Death struck the animal.

### Revenant NPC injured
The injury *slowly* heals. The NPC is still alive and functioning no matter what the injury is, and seems somehow ignorant of the fact that they *are* injured.

By day three this happens with Vernalis falling off the roof of the church while trying to repair it. He stands right up with a clearly broken neck.
