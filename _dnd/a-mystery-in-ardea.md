Solve a mystery on a remote island where nothing is quite as it seems.

## Setting
Caledon is an archipelago nation caught in the middle of two warring empires. The Caledonian King, absorbed in defending his nation during this conflict, has turned the enforcement of laws and collection of taxes over to adventurer's guilds, who act as regents for the islands assigned to their care. Many guilds are little better than state-sponsored gangs. Some make a real effort to protect the people under their stewardship. Regardless, most of the islands of Caledon view themselves as being on their own.

One of the more reputable adventurer's guilds is the Hands of Karn. Led by Karn, a retired Caledonian Naval officer, the hands see themselves as a force for peace and stability in this increasingly lawless island nation.

Ardea is a backwater island under the jurisdiction of the Hands of Karn. Largely used for farming and ranching, the island of Ardea hosts a single small town of the same name. The island primarily contributes taxes in the form of food and woolen/leather goods.

## Adventure
Your party is an investigation team within the Hands of Karn. A pair of guild members sent to collect taxes from  Ardea is now a week overdue. Attempts to Scry them indicate the group is still on the island, but have not been able to provide more useful details.

The adventure starts as your party arrives at the island, tasked with returning with the guild members and the taxes they were sent to collect.

## Character Requirements
You should make a level 4 character with a background, skills, and abilities suitable for a mix of investigation and combat. 

In addition to normal class skills, as an agent of the Hands of Karn you are proficient in either Investigation or Perception. You also have proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Nature, Religion, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Survival, Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion.

Your character has not recently been to the island of Ardea.

The core DnD books, plus Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and Xanatharâ€™s Guide to Everything are available resources. Your character *must* be a member of the hands of Karn, but any available backgrounds are allowed.

Your character will have normal starting equipment for their class/background, 2 potions of healing, 1 potion of greater healing, an uncommon consumable item of your choice, and an uncommon permanent item of your choice.

The party has been sent with a divination rod that points to the magical seals used to identify all members of the Hands of Karn.
