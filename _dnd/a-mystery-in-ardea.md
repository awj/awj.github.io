Solve a mystery on a remote island where nothing is quite as it seems.

## Setting

Caledon is an archipelago nation caught in the middle of two warring empires. The Caledonian King, absorbed in defending his nation during this conflict, has turned most administrative duties over to adventurer's guilds to act as regents for their islands. They are responsible for keeping peace and collecting taxes to fund the navy that keeps both empires at bay.

Many guilds are little better than state-sponsored gangs. Some make a real effort to protect the people under their stewardship. Regardless, most of the islands of Caledon view themselves as being on their own.

One of the more reputable adventurer's guilds is the Hands of Karn. Led by Karn, a retired Caledonian Naval officer, the hands see themselves as a force for peace and stability in this increasingly lawless island nation.

## Adventure

Your party is an investigation team within the Hands of Karn. A pair of guild members sent to collect taxes from the backwater island of Ardea is now a week overdue. Attempts to Scry them indicate the group is still on the island, but have not given more useful details.

The adventure starts as your party arrives at the island, tasked with finding the guild members and bringing them home.

## Character Requirements

You should make a level 4 character with a background, skills, and abilities suitable for a mix of investigation and combat. In addition to normal class skills, as an agent of the Hands of Karn you are proficient in Investigation or Perception and one Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom based skill of your choice.

Although you *are* allowed to make a character who is originally from Ardea, this character will not have seen the island for several years.

The core DnD books, plus Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and Xanatharâ€™s Guide to Everything are available resources. Your character *must* be a member of the hands of Karn, but any available backgrounds are allowed.

Your character will have normal starting equipment for their class/background, 2 potions of healing, 1 potion of greater healing, an uncommon consumable item of your choice, and an uncommon permanent item of your choice.

The party has been sent with a divination rod that points to the magical seals used to identify all members of the Hands of Karn.
