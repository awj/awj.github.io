Solve a mystery on a remote island where nothing is quite as it seems.

# NOTE
This was originally intended to a be a one-shot campaign, but quickly grew into something that easily could last 2-3 sessions. I like the concept, and would love to finish it, but it's unfinished and not playable as a one-shot at this point.

## Setting

Caledon is an archipelago nation caught in the middle of two warring empires. The Caledonian King, absorbed in defending his nation during this conflict, has turned most administrative duties over to adventurer's guilds to act as regents for their islands. They are responsible for keeping peace and collecting taxes to fund the navy that keeps both empires at bay.

Many guilds are little better than state-sponsored gangs. Some make a real effort to protect the people under their stewardship. Regardless, most of the islands of Caledon increasingly view themselves as being on their own.

## Adventure

Your party are all members of the Hands of Karn, one of the more reputable guilds in Caledon. The backwater island of Ardea, home to a single farming village, is now a month late in sending their ship to collect supplies. Given that this ship *also* was supposed to bring in the island's taxes, you have been tasked with going to Ardea to determine what is going on.

Your guild has chartered a ship to deliver both your party and the town's supplies. You have been directed to venture inland to the town and seek out Barassus, the town's elder and main contact for the guild.

## Character Requirements

You should make a level 4 character with a background, skills, and abilities suitable for a mix of investigation and combat. In addition to normal class skills, as an agent of the Hands of Karn you are proficient in Investigation or Perception and one Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom based skill of your choice.

Although you *are* allowed to make a character who is originally from Ardea, this character will not have seen the island for several years.

The core DnD books, plus Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and Xanatharâ€™s Guide to Everything are available resources. Your character *must* be a member of the hands of Karn, but any available backgrounds are allowed.

Your character will have normal starting equipment for their class/background, 2 potions of healing, 1 potion of greater healing, an uncommon consumable item of your choice, and an uncommon permanent item of your choice.
